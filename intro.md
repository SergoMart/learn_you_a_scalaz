= Intro

Welcome to the world of Scalaz! If you've arrived here maybe you've heard of it? It's a beatiful place full of typeclasses of functional programming paradigms. What are those you ask? Read on and we'll find out together. 

I began writing this after re-reading a similar introduction in the great Haskell book of a similar (and original) name, "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good". It is intended to be an introduction to scalaz for intermediate and above level scala developers and as a means to improve my own knowledge of the library as well.
